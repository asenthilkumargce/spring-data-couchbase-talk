This is a demo of the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-couchbase[Spring Data Couchbase] integration.

From http://spring.io/projects/spring-data-couchbase[the project page], Spring Data Couchbase is:


============================================================================
The Spring Data Couchbase project provides integration with the Couchbase Server database. Key functional areas of Spring Data Couchbase are a POJO centric model for interacting with Couchbase Buckets and easily writing a Repository style data access layer.
============================================================================

==  The Demo

The example demonstrates *activity* objects. Before running this example, setup views on the Couchbase servers. Go to Couchbase admin console and create a new design document called 'activity' in the default bucket. You then need two views.

View 'all'

```
function (doc, meta) {
  emit(meta.id, null);
}
```

View 'byOrigin'

```
function (doc, meta) {
  if(doc._class == "springCouchbase.domain.Activity" && doc.origin) {
    emit(doc.origin, null);
  }
}
```

== Vagrant

Michael Nitschinger (https://twitter.com/daschl[@daschl]), also lead of the Spring Data Couchbase project, blogged about to get a simple http://blog.couchbase.com/couchbase-cluster-minutes-vagrant-and-puppet[4-node Vagrant cluster up and running here]. I've reproduced his example here in the  `vagrant` directory. To use it, you'll need to install Virtual Box and Vagrant, of course, but then simply run `vagrant up` in the `vagrant` directory.
